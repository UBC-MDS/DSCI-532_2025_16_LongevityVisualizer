### Why Longevity Visualizer?

In today’s rapidly changing world, access to comprehensive and interactive data visualizations is essential. Longevity Visualizer empowers you by providing:

- **Interactive Map Visualization:**  
  Discover life expectancy across countries using an intuitive choropleth map. Higher color intensity represents higher life expectancy, and clicking on a country reveals detailed statistics.

- **Bubble Chart Analysis:**  
  Explore the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita. The bubble sizes indicate CO2 consumption, helping you gauge environmental impact alongside economic metrics.

- **Comparative Trend Analysis:**  
  Use our bottom section to select metrics such as HDI, CO2, Life Expectancy, or Services (%) and compare these values across multiple continents via dynamic bar and line charts.

Dive into the dashboard to uncover patterns and insights that can inform decisions and spark discussions about global development.
